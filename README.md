# Hardware Notes

This repository contains notes, studies, and projects related to hardware, covering topics such as Digital Design, HDLs (Verilog, VHDL), FPGAs, Embedded Systems, and general electronics.

## Contents

This repository is organized into the following main directories:

### `/arduino`

*   **/paul-mcworther-tutorial**: Code and notes from Paul McWhorter's Arduino tutorial series, covering basic electronics, sensors, and actuator logic.

### `/digital-logic`

*   **/university-digital-systems-25.2**: Labwork for the Digital Systems Design course at CIn-UFPE.
*   **/verilog-hdlbits**: Solutions to logic design problems from the [HDLBits](https://hdlbits.01xz.net/) platform.
*   **/fpga-prototyping-book**: Experiments from the book FPGA Prototyping with SystemVerilog by Pong P. Chu. 
## External Projects

Here are some related projects in separate repositories:

*   **[Mini-CPU](https://github.com/rafaelvlt/CPU)**: The final project for the Digital Systems Design course. It features a custom CPU architecture with an LCD, implemented in Verilog and deployed on a DE2-115 FPGA.
*   **[ALU-Gates](https://github.com/rafaelvlt/ALU-SD)**: The first project for the Digital Systems Design course. An Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) designed using Block Diagrams in Quartus and deployed on a DE2-115 FPGA.
*   **[Visagem](https://github.com/rafaelvlt/visagem)**: A portable hacking and security tool built on the STM32F401 with multiple functions.
